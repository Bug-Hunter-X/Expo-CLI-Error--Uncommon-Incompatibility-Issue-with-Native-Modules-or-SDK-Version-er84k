This error typically occurs when you try to use a feature or module in Expo that isn't compatible with the managed workflow, or if there's a mismatch between your Expo SDK version and the native modules you're using.  For example, if you try to directly interact with native Android or iOS code without using the Expo APIs provided for bridging, or if you've installed a native module that hasn't been properly configured for Expo's managed workflow. It can also happen if you have conflicting dependencies in your project. 

```javascript
// Example of problematic code (using a native module directly):
import { NativeModules } from 'react-native';

const { MyNativeModule } = NativeModules;

MyNativeModule.someNativeMethod();
```
