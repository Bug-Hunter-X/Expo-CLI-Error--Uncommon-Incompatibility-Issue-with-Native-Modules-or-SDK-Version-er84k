The solution depends on the exact nature of the incompatibility, but it generally involves using Expo's APIs for interacting with native modules or carefully managing dependencies and SDK versions.  Here's an example of a revised approach avoiding direct native module interaction:

```javascript
// bugSolution.js
// Example of corrected code using Expo's APIs (assuming an equivalent Expo API exists)
import * as ExpoModules from 'expo-modules-core';

const myModule = ExpoModules.getModule('MyExpoModule'); // Replace with actual Expo module

if(myModule){
  myModule.someMethod();
} else {
  console.error('Expo module not found');
}
```

**Key aspects of the solution:**

* **Use Expo APIs:** Instead of directly using `NativeModules`, utilize Expo's equivalents for accessing native functionalities.  This ensures compatibility with the managed workflow. 
* **Check SDK Version Compatibility:** Make sure your Expo SDK version is aligned with the native module's compatibility requirements. Refer to the module's documentation for guidance.
* **Manage Dependencies:** Ensure your project's dependencies don't conflict with each other. Use tools like `npm ls` or `yarn why` to investigate dependency trees and resolve conflicts. 
* **Upgrade Expo:** Consider upgrading Expo to its latest stable version. Newer versions may resolve existing compatibility problems.
