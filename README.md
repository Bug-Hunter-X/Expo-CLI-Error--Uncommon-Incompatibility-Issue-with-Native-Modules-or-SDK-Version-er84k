# Expo CLI Error: Uncommon Incompatibility Issue

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error encountered in Expo CLI related to compatibility issues between the Expo managed workflow and native modules or SDK version mismatches. The error message often lacks specificity, leading to difficulties in debugging.

## Problem

The core issue lies in attempting to use features or modules not fully supported within Expo's managed workflow, or encountering conflicts stemming from SDK version inconsistencies and native module integration.

The `bug.js` file provides an example of problematic code.  This code directly interacts with a native module, bypassing Expo's bridging mechanisms. This often manifests in cryptic error messages during build or runtime.

## Solution

The solution involves refactoring the code to adhere to Expo's managed workflow guidelines. The `bugSolution.js` file presents a revised version that utilizes Expo's provided APIs or alternative approaches compatible with the managed workflow. It might include updating dependencies, ensuring SDK version alignment, and correctly configuring any necessary native modules using Expo's methods.

## Reproduction

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `expo start`.
4. Observe the error encountered (if the `bug.js` version is used).
5. Replace `bug.js` with `bugSolution.js` to see the corrected version.

## Note

Specific error messages may vary based on the nature of the incompatibility. This repository aims to highlight a common pattern rather than a specific, easily reproducible error.
